# Piscine Test for School 1337

Welcome to my Piscine test for accessing School 1337. This repository contains my solutions for the test, focusing mainly on C and Shell programming languages. The Piscine test is a comprehensive evaluation that serves as a gateway to the school. It assesses your knowledge and skills in various areas of computer science, including algorithms, data structures, and system programming.

The test primarily involves solving problems using the C and Shell languages. It requires a deep understanding of these languages and the ability to apply this knowledge to real-world scenarios. The solutions presented here are my attempts to pass this test and gain admission to School 1337.

Please feel free to explore the code, ask questions, or suggest improvements. Your feedback is appreciated and will help me grow as a programmer.
